# Service

TestGlossary offers an API Service to be used, and documentation for that is also available in well stablished formats - once the server is up and running:

- `OpenAPI v3`:  accessing `/api/openapi.json` 
- `swagger`:  accessing `/api/docs` 
- `redocs`:  accessing `/api/redocs` 

While you may find some discussion here about the funcionalities, feel free to visit the the links above.
